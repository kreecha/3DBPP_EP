AlnsVnD.py - Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) and Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) are both metaheuristics
used to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems. This file purpose to solve 3D Bin Packing.

I want to explore 3 algorithms to solve 3 3D bin packing problem:

 1) Extreme Point Heuristics seminal work by Crainic, Perboli, and Tadei (2008). https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11385818.pdf
 2) Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) based on Pisinger, D., & Ropke, S. (2007). A general heuristic for vehicle routing problems.
 Computers & Operations Research, 34(8), 2403-2435.
 3) Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) based on Hemmelmayr, V. C., Cordeau, J. F., & Crainic, T. G. (2012). An adaptive large neighborhood search heuristic
 for the multi-echelon vehicle routing problem.

A comprehensive implementation of Extreme Point-based heuristics for the 3D bin packing problem, based on the
